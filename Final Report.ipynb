    "\n",
    "The novel coronavirus virus (COVID - 19) began its worldwide spread on [January 9th, 2020](https://www.ajmc.com/view/a-timeline-of-covid19-developments-in-2020), going on to infect hundreds of thousands of people. It has been almost 19 months since the virus first broke, and one thing that has been clear to see is the lack of sophistication in the ability of the United States to produce, store, and distribute COVID-19 vaccines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the many large pharmaceutical companies in the US, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson were the first three to commercially produce and administer these vaccines. While having a more than one vaccine provider was advantageous, it posed logistical challenges due to the manufacturing differences, and gave rise to an interesting optimization question: What is the most cost effective way to produce a COVID-19 vaccines and distribute them across the nation?\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the modelling fidelity and decrease the representational gap, we attempted to design the model based off of real world information (e.g., actual locations that source ingredients for vaccine production, locations that manufacture the vaccine, and actual locations that would need the vaccine) . However, for the sake of seeing more interesting results, we decided to use artificial values for many of the modelling data elements (this is further explained in the following sections).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources Map  ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have a map of what we call the \"sources\" in our model. These are the locations that at which ingredients for vaccine production can be sourced from. Since Pfizer is the [largest](https://www.imarcgroup.com/top-players-global-active-pharmaceutical-ingredients-market) [Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API)](https://www.contractpharma.com/contents/view_online-exclusives/2020-03-05/api-supply-for-us-market/) company in the US, we chose our ingredient sourcing sites from the list of [Pfizer ingredient manufacturing locations](https://www.pfizer.com/products/pfizer-global-supply/us-manufacturing-sites/): Andover, MA; McPherson, KA; Sanford, NC.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/imgs/src_nodes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sites Map ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have a map of what we call the \"sites\" in our model. These are the locations that at which ingredients for vaccine production are collected and the vaccines are actually manufactued. Pfizer has two vaccine production centers in the US, but for this study we will only look at the larger one: [Kalamazoo, Michigan](https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine/manufacturing-and-distribution). Moderna relied on a third party drug manufacturer, Catalent, to produce it's vaccine. Catalent had a single production site in the US at [Bloomington, Indiana](https://www.catalent.com/catalent-news/moderna-and-catalent-announce-long-term-strategic-collaboration-for-dedicated-vial-filling-of-modernas-covid-19-vaccine-and-clinical-portfolio/#:~:text=(NYSE%3A%20CTLT)%2C%20the,vial%20filling%20line%20for%20the). Johnson and Johnson was granted oversight of the vaccine distribution center in [Baltimore, Maryland](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/04/984274691/johnson-johnson-to-oversee-vaccine-production-at-baltimore-facility), and used that location as it's base of vaccine distribution in the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we use this information as the basis for creating the topology of our network, our model allows the production of any type of vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson) at any of these sites. This was intentionally done to better reflect that during an emergency session, every production site would be working to produce as many of any type of vaccine when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/imgs/prod_nodes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Destinations Map ### \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have a map of what we call the \"destinations\" in our model. These are the locations that vaccines need to be shipped to. These were chosen to be the three most populated cities in the US: [New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050815/top-10-most-developed-cities-us.asp). The distribution of the populations of the age groups in these cities was synthetically generated. \n",

    "We chose to model the problem of maufacturing, storing, and distributing the three types of the COVID-19 vaccine within a single time period as a Minimum-Cost Network Flow (MCNF) optimizaiton problem. The problem was then expanded across a three month time period, thus, including features of a Multi-Period (MP) Transportation Problem (TP). \n",
    "\n",
    "A MCNF models a problem as a directed graph, allowing the amount of material (in this case, ingredients and vaccines) to move along certain arcs (directed edges between nodes in the graph). This model optimizes for providing the best routing scheme to get all required material from source nodes to site nodes (production sites) to destination nodes. Since the the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and distribution process is an archetype of such a use case, the MNCF model matches the nuances of this problem well. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we incorporated time, the problem took on additional features that are common to MP-TPs, which allowed the model to incorporate the possibility of storing ingredients and vaccines at different locations. This matches the real world use case, since the production and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines is a problem that spans beyond a single instance (i.e., multiple months). "

    "What's interesting to see here is that at the Kalamazoo and and Bloomington locations, we don't start out with enough employees to meet vaccine manufacturing demands in a cost effective way. So at these two locations, there is an influx of employees. Further, we see that in the first month (when the influx occurs), only mid-level type scientists are hired. This tells us that the mid-level type scientist are the most cost effective workers in the job market. Additionally, we see no change in the distribution of workers at the Baltimore location. This can be attributed to this location starting out with a large number of employees (34), yet only needing to produce 15 mL of the Johnson vaccine every month (see 4.3 for further clarification). This tells us that this plant is most likely overstaffed.\n",

While this number bears little meaning since the values chosen were the data section were artificial, it shows the succintness of the model to be able to collapse a variety of information into easy to interpret results. \n",

In our model, this detail is a bit obfuscated, as we assume the vaccine requirements per age demographic accounts for this. For robustness and improved usability, it would be nice to incorporate this in the data processing sections.\n",

    "* Introduce slack variables to see how \"out-of-the-way\" we are going in order to satisfy the vaccine demands. While these requirements are meant to reflect how many people **want** to receive a dose of the vaccine, an easier metric to retreive is how many people **should** get the vaccine (which we assume to be greatly than equal to the requirements outlined in this project).\n",
